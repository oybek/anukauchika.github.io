### [Anuka Uchika](https://anukauchika.github.io)

This is a simple single page quizz app to learn Scala, Spark and some other
stupid things. If you want to add a quizz send me a [PR](https://github.com/sherzodv/anukauchika.github.io/blob/master/src/quizmap.json).

Made with :coffee: bore using React, JavaScript, Webpack and more terrible stuff.

Idea stolen from [the html5 quiz](http://thehtml5quiz.com) and cruelly reworked.
